    "reason": "[LLM-MULTI-TF] The price is currently in a downtrend and is positioned between the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels, indicating a potential reversal. The RSI and Stochastic RSI are both in overbought territory across multiple timeframes, suggesting a correction is likely. Volume is rising, but this could be a sign of a final push before a reversal. Therefore, a short position is recommended with a close stop loss above the recent resistance."
